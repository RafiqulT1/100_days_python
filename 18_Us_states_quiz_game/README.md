# US State Quiz Game
This project got inspiration from [Sporcle's states quiz](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states).
This educational game challenges you to guess and learn all the states in the US.

## How to play
As the game starts, you will be presented with a blank map of the United States. A prompt will ask you to enter the name of a state. Each time you correctly guess a state's name, that state will appear on the map in its correct location. Your goal is to correctly identify all 50 states.

To exit the game simply type `exit` in the prompt. It will stop the game and generate `guessed_states.csv` & `unguessed_states.csv` files, more about them in [Features](https://github.com/RafiqulT1/100_days_python/tree/main/18_Us_states_quiz_game#features) section

## Features
- **Interactive Learning:** As you correctly guess each state, it will be displayed on the map, reinforcing your memory through visual learning.
- **Progress Tracking:** The game generates two `.csv` files: `guessed_states.csv` and `unguessed_states.csv`. These files list the states you guessed correctly and those you missed, respectively, allowing you to review and improve your knowledge.

## Requirements
- Python 3.0 or above
- `turtle` module (typically included with Python's standard library package)
- `pandas` module: please install pandas applying ```pip install pandas```. More info: [How To Install Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
